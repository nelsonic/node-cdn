#CDN Uploader
---

### What This Module Does

- Creates a REST API Wrapper Method which allows any app to upload a static file (image/css/js/json) to Amazon WebServices (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) and **returns** a **URL** for the uploaded file.

---

### Intro

If you have no *idea* what a Content Delivery Network 
[CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) is, *in a nutshell* it means the **people** visiting have to **wait less** time (for pages to load). This is because the "content" (images, text, videos and "scripts" - such as CSS and JavaScript are stored/served *closer* to them on world-wide-web)

![CDN Diagram shows one server vs several servers distributed near the client](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/NCDN_-_CDN.png "CDN means content is served from the web server that is closest to the visitor")

Take some time to watch this **Video** on 
How CDNs Work: http://youtu.be/dZ5aXGFnxI4 [Watch in **720p** *Full Screen*]

Using a CDN is the *single* greatest **performance boost** you can give your Web Application. 

See: 

* [**Yahoo** Web Developer **Rules**](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) : http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html (I recommend using [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) to monitor your progress :-)
* [**Google** Web Page Speed **Best Practices**](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro) : https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro

If you are not *using* a CDN for your NodeJS projects, 
this module will help you get started. ;-)


The cost of using a CDN has decreased greatly in the past few years due to increased competition. What *used* to cost *thousands* of dollars (or pounds/euros/yen...) now costs just pennies. The hardest part is getting everything *set up* ...

There are several great CDN Providers out there; the main ones are:

- [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com) (the industry leader) 
- [NetDna](http://www.netdna.com/pricing/) - almost as fast as Akamai but with 
transparent pay-as-you-go pricing. But there's a **minimum** fee of 
**$800** *per* **month**!!  Not exactly BootStrap sort of Money...!
- [RackSpace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud-files/) - Uses Akamai's 
technology but offers pay-as-you-go pricing (more expensive than Amazon's Cloudfront)
- [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com/pricing) - decent but *annoying* 
**annual pricing** and "overage" charges!
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) **CloudFront**](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/) Offers **95%** of the **speed** of **Akamai** for a *fraction* (half?) *the price* and **no contract** or minimum spend!
- [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is not considered to be a "*Real* CDN" 
by *purists* because its not designed to *minimise latency* (by distributing copies of files to several nodes) It does offer many of 
the benefits of a CDN (different server for static content speeds up page load) for *minimal* costs! And *most importantly* the ["*Free Tier*"](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) means you can use S3 for **FREE** for the first *year* (*below 5GB* - which *trust me* is **plenty** of space!)

For a **Report** on **CDN Performance and Availability** 
visit: http://www.cedexis.com/country-reports/ 
(click on the "CDNs" tab on the main menu) shows clearly that 
you **get more** when you **pay more**. 
At the time of writing Akamai has an average latency of 102ms '
whereas AWS's **CloudFront** is 106ms; a negligeable difference.

For our purposes using **Amazon's S3** + **CloudFront** 
will provide a *massive* boost to any NodeJS (or *any* other Web App!) and is a great way to **get started**!

If you are *completely* new to Amazon Web Services (AWS) I recommend watching [@Sayanee](https://github.com/sayanee)'s [build-podcast.com](http://build-podcast.com/)

### Implementation

We are using:

#### [Lingua Franca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) : [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

If you are toally *new* to CoffeeScript, *welcome* to the **Future**!! 

There has been much **debate** in the JavaScript / NodeJS Community as to wether you should learn CoffeeScript or just continue writing (*mediocre*) JavaScript ... It boils down to Five Things:

- Code Clarity - CoffeeScript forces indentation and is "whitespace significant" (like Python)
- Consistent Quality - CoffeeScript is designed to *Pass* [JS Lint](http://www.javascriptlint.com) meaning it follows all the JavaScript Best Practices described in [Douglas Crockford](http://javascript.crockford.com/)'s ["JavaScript: The Good Parts"](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742). 

Essentially people *new* to JS development *hack* at the problem or copy-paste the "solution" by googling, by contrast, people that do the [Homework](https://twitter.com/nelsonic/status/321950687619584001/photo/1) and have experience of **debugging** *terrible* (rushed/unstructured/untested/undocumented) JS code learn to appreciate the value of enforced standards.

CoffeeScript forces you to respect whitespace. While initially annoying (for those of you who don't have a background in Python), 
you will soon see the *benefit* when working in a *Team* of having everbody's code *look consistent*.

Here are a couple of simple tutorials to get you started:

* GitHub: https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script
* [NodeTuts](http://nodetuts.com/) Video intro by Pedro Teixeira [pgte](https://github.com/pgte) http://vimeo.com/18429839 ... Pedro works for [NodeJitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) ... Follow him! [@pgte](https://twitter.com/pgte)

* http://glennstovall.com/blog/2012/05/07/rapid-development-with-node-dot-js-and-coffeescript/

>> Must move this block to CoffeeScript Blog Post / Rant ... ;-)


#### Testing with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) 

For our *Unit Testing* https://jasmine.github.io/
If you are *new* to using Jasmine I recommend you take the time to *learn it well* by working through these tutorials:

- Basic intro to Jasmine: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine/
- [CoffeeScript **Koans**](https://github.com/sleepyfox/coffeescript-koans) TTD/BDD Tutorials (time: 60 mins) 
- CoffeeScript Cookbook section on [Testing with Jasmine](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/testing/testing_with_jasmine) (time: 30 mins)
- Little Book on CoffeeScript (50 pages = 60 mins) http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/index.html
- https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node

#### Templating with [ECT](http://ectjs.com/)

Note: Templating is **ONLY** used in *testing*. This module does not *dictate* any templating engine. You can still use what ever you are using. ;-)

On previous projects I've used [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/) and [CoffeeKup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup)
but decided to try [ECT](https://github.com/baryshev/ect) because it *claims* to be **Faster** than the more *established* alternatives. see: [Templating Engine Benchmark](https://github.com/baryshev/template-benchmark) https://github.com/baryshev/template-benchmark

Long story short, my 3 reasons for chosing ECT for this project:

- Its (a **LOT**) **faster** than [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) / [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) etc!
- The Templates **Look like HTML** (closely matches output so easier to debug)
- **Minimal Learning Curve** for people who are familiar with HTML.
- (Bonus) A change from Jade ... ;-)

#### Primary Dependency: [Knox](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox) 

The Knox module by [LearnBoost](https://www.learnboost.com/): https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox it is the most popular Amazon WebServices (AWS) Simple Storage System (S3) Module for NodeJS - read the examples on the module's GitHub page and then subtract all the superfluous "punctuation" (curly braces, semi-colons and "vars"...)

#### Notes to Future-Self:
If you need to *update* the version of **Jasmine** go to: https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases

I'm using [**CDNJS**](http://cdnjs.com/) http://cdnjs.com/ to source all Backbone JS dependencies in **SpecRunner.html** (but you do not *need* to know Backbone to use this module!)

- http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js
- http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.4.4/underscore-min.js
- http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.0.0/backbone-min.js
- http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/coffee-script/1.6.2/coffee-script.min.js

If you need to update any of these version numbers, go for it and submit a patch to me!

In production you may want to host these Static JS files on your own CDN to have *full control* over what code you are running (#Security), but I trust [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (for now...) so just using their bandwidth. ;-)
